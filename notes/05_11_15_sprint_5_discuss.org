* Tasks
  Goals:

  * Club-in-a-box
    * Figure out how to leverage summer camp to help us figure out what to put
      in the CIAB
    * Be explicit about what we actually want the outcomes of the clubs to be
    * Summer camp
      * Acquire students
        1) Throw up a website
        2) Message all the outlets we're aware of for the website
      * Figure out potential iteration structure
        * Do we want a two week format? Multiple at the same time? What does it
          look like?

* Footnotes
** Zach
*** Does it actually make sense to have club leaders on these calls?
*** How can we be more effective during these calls
*** Should these calls be discussions or throwing information around?
    Perhaps we should break up what we're working on into projects and have the
    leaders of each project just say what they're doing for the week and be
    responsibile for making sure it's the right thing to do
