# hackEDU - Project Management

**DEPRECATED:** This repository is deprecated.

We've since moved to a kanban workflow using a [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/)
board in [hackedu/hackedu](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu) that references
all of our active repositories.

_Inspired by [ipfs's pm repository](https://github.com/ipfs/pm)._

This is a repository for general hackEDU project management.

## Sprints

hackEDU is adopting a sprint cycle. Each sprint gives us a manageable amount of
work per person, to be completed within the cycle. It adds a heartbeat to our
development. We will seldom add or drop work mid-sprint, though exceptions may
emerge. This means incoming PRs or new issues may not be addressed until the
next sprint. We will try to make sure things don't get backlogged for long
periods of time.

If you'd like to join a sprint, let `@zachlatta` know how much time you want to
commit and what you'd like to take on. The best way to do this is to ping him on
the `#hackedu` IRC where his nick is `zrl`. It is recommended to take things off
the backlog, and check in with the team at the daily "sprint checkin".

* Sprint duration: 1 week
* Sprint discuss: Mondays at `5:30pm Pacific time, 8:30pm Eastern time` via +hangout (link posted in IRC in `#hackedu` and the hackEDU Leaders' Facebook Group)
* Sprint checkin: daily at `11:00am Pacific time, 2:00pm Eastern time` on `#hackedu-standups` IRC (Freenode)

Each sprint will be synthesized into an issue in this repo, as described in
https://www.zenhub.io/blog/how-the-zenhub-team-uses-zenhub-boards-on-github/#keepingarecordofsprints.

### Sprint Checkin (Sync)

The sprint checkin a quick sync-up (on IRC) to fine tune the sprint. It helps
the sprint master know what's progressing, what's blocking people, and what
adjustments need to be made. This sync is critical to ensure the success of the
sprint as a whole. If you cannot make it to a sprint checkin, leave your
update + comments on IRC before the sync happens. If you won't be doing work the
day of the sprint checkin, you're still expected to participate in the
checkin. Just mention that you won't be doing work/that there's been no
progress.

Each person must answer (kanban style):

* What obstacles are impeding my progress?
* (looking at the sprint assignments) What has progressed?
